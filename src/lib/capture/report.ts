 * Ported whole from `extension/src/lib/report.ts` — the walkthrough's prose, its
 * per-take JSON and its listing. It is written for a coding agent first and a
 * human second: evidence up front, no prose the model has to wade through, and
 * every image path relative so the file set can be moved.
 *
 * Two adaptations for the phone path, both of which produce byte-identical
 * output to the extension's whenever the inputs match it:
 *   1. `origin` is empty here (a clip was recorded against a phone, not a tab),
 *      so the header and the MANIFEST omit that segment rather than trail a
 *      separator with nothing after it.
 *   2. `videoFile` names the container the clip actually arrived in, so the
 *      report cites `walkthrough.mp4` when that is what was uploaded.
